sensors in Elixir.

## Usage

Here's an example use:

```elixir
iex> {:ok, bmp} = BMP280.start_link(bus_name: "i2c-1", bus_address: 0x77)
{:ok, #PID<0.29929.0>}
iex> BMP280.measure(bmp)
{:ok,
 %BMP280.Measurement{
   altitude_m: 13.842046523689644,
   dew_point_c: 18.438691684856007,
   humidity_rh: 51.59938493850065,
   pressure_pa: 99836.02154563366,
   temperature_c: 29.444089211523533
 }}
```

Depending on your hardware configuration, you may need to modify the call to
`BMP280.start_link/1`. See `t:BMP280.options/0` for parameters.

All measurements are reported in SI units.

The altitude measurement is computed from the measured barometric pressure. To
be accurate, it requires either the current sea level pressure or the current
altitude. Here's an example:

```elixir
iex> BMP280.force_altitude(bmp, 100)
:ok
```

Subsequent altitude reports should be more accurate until the weather changes.

## Support for other Bosch barometric sensors

Other Bosch sensors tend to look similar, but they have enough differences that
they do not work yet. If you're using one of them, please help me by either
verifying that they work or adding support for them.
